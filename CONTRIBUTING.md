**Thanks for contributing to KnockoutApp!**

This is a small list of guidelines for contributing to the project:

-Use the same code style used by the rest of the project

-Check for existing [pull requests](https://github.com/paglias/KnockoutApp/pulls)/[discussions](https://github.com/paglias/KnockoutApp/issues) about an issue/feature before sending a pull request or creating a new issue

-Include tests when adding a new feature

-It's not necessary to send a rebuilt version of knockout.app.js and knockout.app.min.js or the updated documented source code
