<h2 class="page-header">sync <small>model.sync( model, method, options )</small></h2>

The sync method used by the model.

If the model is contained into a collection then it uses collection's sync method while if it isn't <a href="#SyncKnockoutApp.Sync(method,model,options)">KnockoutApp.Sync</a> is used.

Can be overriden to use a custom method.
