[KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com) is a fantastic library but it lacks of a proper structure for building apps so that every time you'll need to rewrite all the code for models, communcicating with the server and so on...

**KnockoutApp** changes this. Heavily inspired by [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.com) it provides a **Model** class, a **Collection** class and a **Sync** method for syncing data back with the server.
