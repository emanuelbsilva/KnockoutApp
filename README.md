**KnockoutApp** is a framework for building apps using [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/).

It's heavily inspired to [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org) and it's licensed under the MIT license.

**ATTENTION**: this release (0.1) is the first one and it will surely contain a lot of bugs (which can be reported [here](https://github.com/paglias/KnockoutApp/issues)).

#Getting Started

Just include *knockout.app.min.js* in your html page to start using it (remember that KnockoutJS in necessary).

You can find documentation [here](https://github.com/paglias/KnockoutApp/blob/master/documentation.md).

Give a look to the [annotated source code](http://paglias.net/KnockoutApp/annotated-source-code/knockout.app.html) and to the [example](http://paglias.net/KnockoutApp/example/).

#Contributing

KnockoutApp uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) as the build tool and [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) for generating annotated source code.

Contributions are welcome, just send a pull request (it is preferred to target the development branch instead of the master one).

For general discussion, features request and bugs report use [Github Issues](https://github.com/paglias/KnockoutApp/issues)

#Credits

A big thank to [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org) for the inspiration given to that project (and also for the *extendClass* method that has been taken from it)!
